                        A regular expression is a language or string accepted by finite automata. A regular expression is shown as symbols and not as words it is similar to the expression in mathematics with operations and variables. In a regular expression, the operation used is multiply (and) and add(or). This is used to determine which string is accepted in finite automata.

                            In this activity, we are going to design a DFA based on a given language. My strategy is to think of the smallest accepted string and create a simple model that generates that string. Next, I will think of other accepted strings and add more states and transition that follows the accepted sting. If possible, I am creating a transition to itself to accept more possible strings but still considering the language. And lastly, add a transition from the final state to generate a more accepted string.                        </h5>

                        A Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols by running through a state sequence that may not be uniquely determined by the string.
                        <br>An NFA is defined by a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where:
                        <br>- Q is a finite set of states
                        <br>- Σ is a finite set of symbols called the alphabet

                        <br>- δ : Q × Σ → P(Q) is the transition function.
                        <br>
                        <br>The main difference between DFA and NFA is that in DFA, for each input symbol, there exists exactly one next state. In contrast, for an NFA, there may exist many paths for specific input from the current state to the next state.

                        <h5 class="txtExplanation">This PDA is for the language <strong>L = {W ∈ {0,1}* | W is palindrome}</strong>. It reads the first half of the string and push every element in a stack. The other half the element is popped, if the element matches the top of the stack in every pop and the remeining is an empty string, then the string is palindrome

                            Pushdown automata (PDAs) are used in many real-life applications. One example is whenever your smartphone calculator calculates an arithmetic expression, it uses an implementation of the pushdown automata to evaluate it. It verifies that the parentheses are balanced. In the absence of parentheses, it makes sure that the multiplication operator has more precedence than the addition operator.
                            PDAs are also used in compilers to parse programming languages. They are used to recognize context-free languages. PDAs are used to recognize languages that cannot be recognized by finite automata.

                            Turing machine is a foundation of todays computer. The applications can be seen in todays computers such as solving binary and other complicated computations. They are used to model the behavior of any computer that is capable of running a program.
